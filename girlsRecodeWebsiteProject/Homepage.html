        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Have you ever noticed that males tend to get paid more than women in the workplace? 
            For centuries, women have had to serve and treat men as superiors. And this trend continues-- 
            a study conducted recently in 2020 showed that even today, women are still only paid 81 cents for every dollar that is earned by a man. 
            
            Though this number has gradually improved (back in 2015 women were only paid 74 cents for every dollar a man made), studies predict that the wage gap will
            not be bridged until 2059.
        </p>

        <h2>How can we bridge the gap?</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- REFERENCE ARTICLE: https://www.moneyunder30.com/strategies-for-narrowing-the-gender-pay-gap -->
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, adopting transparent pay practices can help to narrow the gender pay gap by up to 30%.</li>
            <br>
            <li>According to research from the Economic Policy Institute, women working in unions earn an average of 94 cents to the dollar when compared to 
                men, while non-union women earn only 78 cents to the dollar. Uniting women under a common cause is a great contributor to gender equality.</li>
            <br>
            <li>When negotiating salary expectations with prospective applicants and new hires, employers often ask employees their salary history 
                from previous jobs, perpetuating a cycle of unequal pay even across successive jobs and companies. By bringing these issues to the attention
                of the employers, we can help reduce the amount of gender inequality women face in the workplace.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is WPTA? </h2>
        <p>
            WPTA stands for Women's Pay Transparency Association. Here, we prioritize changing the pay trends that women tend
            to face in male dominated industries by creating an alliance of people who want change. 

            
            By combining notions of transparent pay, womens' workforce unions and urging companies to compete against each other
            for fairer gender equality ratings, we hope to bridge the gap between gender inequality by taking the survey answers 
            we recieve from our website and publishing the statistics in real time. 
            
            Our mission is to spread awareness by shedding light on the gender pay gap. We will provide equal help to all women with their concerns or in seeking better paid jobs.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h2>How can we help?</h2>
        <p>
            By taking survey results and showing the comparisons, we are spreading awareness and spotlighting the issue of the pay gap. With this, we hope to encourgae more companies to equalize the pay between males and gender minority.
            We also want to help females in different fields by letting them know which companies pay more fairer than others. 
            Our graphs show the pay gap between male and gender minority workers in various companies, so if a somone is weighing the pros and cons between companies to decide which one to choose, our graphs could support them.
            The graphs are shown on our "View the Statistics" page linked below!

        <p>We are basing our data off of this quick survey that takes around two minutes to complete. Please help us out by filling it out, and sharing it with others! We want to gather as wide a sample as possible so that we can more accurately calculate pay gaps and to reduce outliers in the data set.</p>
